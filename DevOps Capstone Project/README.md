## SUMMARY

A pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Instructions for local Setup

## Setup the Environment for Testing

* Run `make setup` and then activate the source with `source ~/.capstone/bin/activate`
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies
* Run `make lint` to lint the Dockerfile and app.py

### Running locally `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl

### Setup the Environment to Deploy

* Create IAM role with Admin access.
* Create an AWS EC2 instance for your Jenkins Machine with public ip enabled. (select t2.medium/t3.medium with ubuntu 18.04)
* Attach the previously created IAM role to your Jenkins machine.
* Add the public IP of your Jenkins Machine to your /etc/hosts file with name JenkinsMaster 13.24.53.242 JenkinsMaster
* Login to your Jenkins machine and create default ssh keys for connecting to our Kubernetes cluster nodes.
* Go to your EC2 instance settings and enable port 8080 in your attached security group.

### Setting up Jenkins

Once your Ansible playbook finishes, go to your Jenkins machine's http://jenkinsmachinepublicip:8080 for accessing Jenkins Dashboard then:
* Setup Jenkins with recommended setting and install Blue Ocean plugin.
* Add your docker hub credentials in Jenkins.
* Connect your jenkins to githubrepo.
* Run below command from your Jenkins Machine to check your LoadBalancer service and get the external IP for your app.
$ kubectl get svc
* From EC2 Jenkins terminal, run 'sudo su jenkins' to log in as user. Then run `eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yml` to create cluster.
* Once cluster is built run `kubectl get nodes` to verify nodes are running.
